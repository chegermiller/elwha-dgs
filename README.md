## Description
This repository contains codebases for analysis techniques aimed at characterizing beach sediments and investigating the long-term evolution of a coastal system impacted by human intervention. The goal of this project is to use image analysis methods for both qualitative and quantitative assessments of mixed beach sediments over time.

**Current Updates:**  
As of now, the repository includes our Python Point Count program, which calculates individual grain sizes from image data. Additional projects and tools will be added as the work evolves.

## Projects

### Point Count Python
This project adapts a MATLAB-based codebase to Python in order to calculate grain size estimates from image data. The Python program analyzes labeled points in a provided image, returning a `.xlsx` file with grain location and size data.

### Contributions
This repository is developed through the efforts of Christie Hegermiller, Ian Miller, Daniel Buscombe, Jonathan Warrick, Cal Schurman, and Samuel Alampay
