How to Run:

1. Open DigitalPebbleCountTool
2. Set the number of points you would like to sample per image on line 27 
3. Make sure you have a folder of images
4. Run DigitalPebbleCountTool
5. Select all images you would like to analyze 
6. Next it will prompt you to name an excel file for output
7. Instructions for each image:
    a. Click the two ends of the scale bar to draw a line and type in the length 
       of the scale bar in mm at the bottom
            - zoom in/out with scroll wheel
       click submit when done
    b. Click the sizing you would prefer for the image
    c. For each subimage draw a line for each of the points in the photo. Then submit
8. After everything is done, the output file should be filled in



Things to improve:
- Resized window is hard coded. 1000x750. Could scale it depending on computer
- Handling Errors 
- 7a) have the ability to draw outside image boundries (in case rock is on edge)
- 7a) collect date taken data from image metadata to include into the output file 
- 7a) image should initialize being scaled into the window
- 7a) when image is zoomed in/out points remain relative to the image (will be large when zoomed in)
            - preferred the points remain the same size no matter what the zoom
- 7c) Have points show up one at a time. (Or any other ideas so points to be labelled can be located easily)
~ 8) unsure if data should be formatted in which way:
     - all grain sizes and then all point locations 
     ("grain size 1", grain size 2, ... , grain location 1, grain location 2, ...)
     - grain size paired with grain location
     (grain size 1, grain location 1, grain size 2, grain location 2, ...)
major issue:
- need to rigorously check if the data is correct
     - I did test it and it looked good
